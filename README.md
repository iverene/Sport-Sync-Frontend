## ✨ Key Features

### 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard (IT 313)

  * **Visual Analytics:** Real-time charts (Revenue Trends, Category Performance) powered by `ApexCharts`.
  * **KPI Cards:** Instant view of daily revenue, total transactions, and low stock alerts.
  * **Stock Monitoring:** Color-coded alerts for items reaching critical reorder levels.

### 💰 Point of Sale (POS) Interface

  * **Efficient Workflow:** Fast product lookup via search or barcode scanning simulation.
  * **Dynamic Cart:** Real-time subtotal calculations, change computation, and stock validation before checkout.
  * **Receipts:** Digital receipt previews and transaction history.

### 📦 Inventory Management

  * **CRUD Operations:** Modals for adding, editing, and archiving products without page reloads.
  * **Advanced Filtering:** Filter products by Category, Stock Level, or Price.
  * **Batch Actions:** Quick stock adjustments and price updates.

### 📊 Reporting & Exports (IT 312)

  * **Data Tables:** Sortable and paginated tables for huge datasets.
  * **Client-Side Generation:** Generates professional PDF reports and CSV exports directly in the browser using `jspdf` and `jspdf-autotable`.
  * **Profit Analysis:** Dedicated view for calculating margins and cost-vs-revenue.

### 🔐 Security & Access Control (IT 314)

  * **Protected Routes:** Client-side routing checks user roles (`Admin` vs `Staff`) to restrict access to sensitive pages like Settings or Audit Logs.
  * **Session Management:** Auto-logout on token expiration and secure storage of session state.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v16 or higher)
  * npm (Node Package Manager)
  * The **Sport Sync Backend** must be running locally on port 3000.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sport-sync-frontend.git
    cd sport-sync-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application will typically launch at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ⚙️ Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer (`services/api.js`)

The application uses a centralized API service pattern.

  * **Interceptors:** Automatically attaches JWT tokens to outgoing requests and handles 401 Unauthorized errors by redirecting to login.
  * **Modularity:** API calls are abstracted, keeping UI components clean and focused on rendering.

### State Management (`context/AuthContext.jsx`)

A global Authentication Context wraps the application, managing the user's login state, role permissions, and persisting session data across page reloads.

### Component Reusability

Custom reusable components ensure UI consistency and reduce code duplication:

  * `Table.jsx`: A generic data table with pagination and sorting.
  * `Modal.jsx`: Standardized overlay for forms and alerts.
  * `KpiCard.jsx`: Uniform data presentation widgets.
